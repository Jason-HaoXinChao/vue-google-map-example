## Vue Google Map
By: Hao Xin Chao

### Introduction

This project is a basic application with the following functionalities:
* A search box with autocomplete functionality for the user to input an address.
* A search button for the search box, the user can also search by pressing enter while focused on the search box.
* A button that prompts the user for permission to acquire their current location.
* A map with a marker labelling each of the obtained locations.
* The timezone name and local time of the last searched location is displayed.

The locations obtained from search box and the user's browser will be stored in a table. The table has the following features:
* Pagination, displaying maximum of 10 records per page.
* A checkbox at the beginning of each row to let the user select multiple records at the same time.
* A delete button on the top to remove all selected records as well as their markers on the map. The button is only enabled if at least one record is selected.
